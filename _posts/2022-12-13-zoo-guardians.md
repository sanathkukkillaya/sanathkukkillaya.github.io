This mobile game was developed for the Smithsonian's National Zoo in partnership with Jumpstart Games.

In this game players can build and customize their own zoos. They can take care of the animals and complete various quests to level up the zoo. They can also collect cards to learn about different species and understand what these species need to thrive in human care and in the wild. Players also have the ability to interact with animals via augmented reality,

My contributions:
* Regularly interacted with the client and was involved in support and maintenance of the product.
* Fixed various gameplay issues, especially related to collecting of resources and levelling up.
* Reduced the loading time by around 30%.
