<hr />

This was a mobile slot game with multi-player features and guild mechanics.

In this game, players spin a slot to win coins, using which they build their village in the game. Before starting, players choose one among three clans to be a part of: Ninjas, Knights, or Vikings. Each of these clans has its representative characters and symbols. Players can raid villages of people from other clans and get coins. In addition, players can compete against members of their clans to see who raids the most enemy clans and reaches the top of their clanâ€™s leaderboard.

#### My contributions:
- Updated the UI of the slot machine to a newer design.
- Fixed issues related to multiplayer resource updation during raids.
- Regularly interacted with the client for the support and maintenance of the product.
