author: Sanath Kukkillaya
author_bio: Hi, my name is Sanath Kukkillaya. I am a professional game developer.  
author_bio_description: >
  I'm interested in two things: programming and games. Interest in programming led me to take up an engineering degree in Computers
  and Information Science and eventually a career in software development.  
    
  I started off as a software engineer working on Microsoft Dynamics CRM customization through a combination of C# and Javascript.  
  While this was a great experience, I always wanted to do something more in line with my passion for video games.
  This eventually led me to Unity game engine. Being already experienced in C#, I was quickly able to learn Unity.
  After around 5 years in enterprise software, I was finally able to pursue my passion as a career choice.  
    
  For the past 3 years, I have been a full fledged game developer. Game development lets me combine my interest in programming
  with my passion for games. I have primarily worked on Unity engine, and have developed numerous mobile games for both Android
  and iOS platforms. While I haven't yet got a chance to work on a large scale AA or AAA game for PC or console, it does remain on the
  top of my wishlist.  
    
  I have spent close to 8 years of my life as a software engineer. The game of life in game development has just started, and I hope
  to have a great time playing this game for many long years!
